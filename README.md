We present Fine-grained Prompt Tuning (FPT) and FPT+ for medical image classification. FPT and FPT+ are parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) methods that significantly improve memory efficiency over existing PETL methods, especially in the high-resolution context commonly encountered in medical image analysis.

- **Messidor-2 (Fundus image)** [[Images](https://www.adcis.net/en/third-party/messidor2/)] [[Labels](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/google-brain/messidor2-dr-grades)]
- **DDR (Fundus image)** [[Homepage](https://github.com/nkicsl/DDR-dataset)]
- **ISIC 2016 (Dermoscopic image)** [[Homepage](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/landing/2016/)]
- **ISIC 2018 (Dermoscopic image)** [[Homepage](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/landing/2018/)]

## How to Use
We use the Messidor-2 dataset as an example in the instructions.

### 1. Build dataset
Organize the Messidor-2 dataset as follows:

```
messidor2_dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── class1/
│   │   ├── image1.jpg
│   │   ├── image2.jpg
│   ├── class2/
│   │   ├── image3.jpg
│   │   ├── image4.jpg
│   ├── class3/
│   ├── ...
├── val/
├── test/
```

Ensure the `val` and `test` directories have the same structure as `train`. Then, update the `data_path` value in `/configs/dataset/messidor2.yaml` with the path to the Messidor-2 dataset.

### 2. Preloading
Pre-store features from LPM by running:
```bash
python preload.py dataset=messidor2
```

### 3. Training
To train the model, run:
```bash
python main.py dataset=messidor2
```



## Train on Your Own Dataset
### 1. Build your dataset
Organize your dataset similarly to Messidor-2.

### 2. Create and update configurations
Update the configurations marked as '???' in `/configs/dataset/customized.yaml`.

### 3. Preloading
```bash
python preload.py dataset=customized
```
If the image resolution is very large and causes out-of-memory issues, decrease the batch size for preloading:
```bash
python preload.py dataset=customized ++train.batch_size=4
```
After preloading, FPT or FPT+ can still be run with a large batch size.

### 4. Training
To train the model, run:
```bash
python main.py dataset=customized
```



## Other Configurations
You can update the configurations in `/configs`. Hydra is employed to manage configurations. For advanced usage, please check the [Hydra documentation](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/).

### 1. Run FPT
The default method is FPT+. To run FPT, update the command with `network=FPT`:
```bash
python preload.py dataset=messidor2 network=FPT
python main.py dataset=messidor2 network=FPT
```
Note that FPT+ and FPT doesn't share the preloaded features.

### 2. Pre-trained model
Most ViT-based models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models) uploaded by google/facebook/timm can be directly employed. Default pre-trained weights is `google/vit-base-patch16-384`. To change the LPM, set the pre-trained path in `/configs/network/FPT+.yaml` or update the command to:
```bash
python main.py dataset=messidor2 ++network.pretrained_path=google/vit-base-patch16-384
```
Validated pre-trained weights in this work:
- google/vit-base-patch16-384
- google/vit-large-patch16-384
- facebook/dino-vitb8
- facebook/dino-vitb16

### 3. Disable prelading
To disable preloading, set the 'preload_path' in `/configs/dataset/your_dataset.yaml` to 'null' or update the command to:
```bash
python main.py dataset=messidor2 ++dataset.preload_path=null
```

### 4. Learning rate
To change the learning rate, set the 'learning_rate' in `/configs/dataset/your_dataset.yaml` or update the command to:
```bash
python main.py dataset=messidor2 ++dataset.learning_rate=0.0001
```

### 5. Random seed
To control randomness, set the 'seed' to a non-negative integer in `/configs/config.yaml` or update the command to:
```bash
python main.py dataset=messidor2 ++base.seed=0
```
